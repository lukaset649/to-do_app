# to-do app
The To-Do List is a simple task management app built using HTML for the page structure, CSS for styling and responsiveness, and JavaScript (with Fetch API) for handling the form, adding tasks, and deleting tasks. The app allows users to add, view, and delete tasks from a list. Itâ€™s designed to help with organizing daily tasks through an interactive to-do list. The backend is powered by Node.js with Express.js, and the tasks are stored in a MongoDB database, allowing for persistent data storage across sessions.
